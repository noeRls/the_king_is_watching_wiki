BLACKSMITH'S FARM

Building Information:
- Cycle: 2s
- Capacity: 500

Requirements:
- Increases by 1 (tool/iron resource)
- Increases by 1 (resource icon)

Function: Produces multiple resources at the same time but slower

Build Cost:
- 40 (red circular resource - appears to be food/supplies)
- 40 (resource icon - appears to be wood/material)

This is a hybrid production building that can generate multiple resource types simultaneously, though at reduced speed compared to specialized buildings. The extremely high population requirement (500) suggests this is an advanced late-game structure.
